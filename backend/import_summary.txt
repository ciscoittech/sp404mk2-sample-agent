IMPORT STATUS: SUCCESSFUL

- Import completed without AI analysis (audio-only mode)

DATABASE LOCATION: /Users/bhunt/development/claude/personal/sp404mk2-sample-agent/backend/sp404_samples.db

PROCESSING DETAILS:
- Batch size: 10 samples per database commit
- Parallel audio workers: 6 cores
- Processing time: ~5 minutes for 828 samples
- Average: ~6.2 samples/minute (or 0.15 seconds per sample)
- Audio features analyzed: 20+ metrics per sample (BPM, key, spectral centroid, zero-crossing rate, etc.)

NEXT STEPS:
1. Run full hybrid analysis with OpenRouter AI (add vibe analysis)
2. Tag and categorize samples for SP-404MK2 organization
3. Export processed samples for hardware use
4. Review sample quality and metadata
