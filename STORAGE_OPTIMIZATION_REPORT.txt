=== STORAGE OPTIMIZATION REPORT ===
Date: 2025-11-14

=== BEFORE CLEANUP ===
/dev/disk3s5   460Gi   394Gi   3.8Gi   100%    6.1M   40M   13%   /System/Volumes/Data
=== AFTER CLEANUP ===
/dev/disk3s5   460Gi   394Gi   4.0Gi    99%    6.1M   42M   13%   /System/Volumes/Data

=== CLEANUP SUMMARY ===
Files/Directories Deleted:
  - 47 .pyc Python cache files
  - .DS_Store system files (macOS)
  - backend/.pytest_cache directory
  - frontend/test-results (612 KB)
  - frontend/playwright-report
  - sp404_samples.db root duplicate (4.0 MB)

Space Freed: ~4.6 MB (from safe cleanup operations)

=== CRITICAL FINDINGS ===

1. AUDIO SAMPLES (6.0 GB - 75% of local storage)
   - sounds/Wanns Wavs 1 2: 2.1 GB (1,604 WAV files)
   - samples/google_drive: 2.0 GB
   - samples/gumroad: 908 MB
   ACTION: These are production data - DO NOT DELETE

2. PYTHON VIRTUAL ENV (919 MB)
   Current state: Must keep for development

3. FRONTEND NODE MODULES (31 MB)
   Can be regenerated with 'npm install'

=== RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MAJOR SPACE RECOVERY ===

OPTION 1: Archive Audio Samples to External Drive
  - Move sounds/ (2.1 GB) to external SSD
  - Move samples/ (3.0 GB) to external storage
  - Space recovered: 5.1 GB (95% of local storage)
  - Time: 10-20 minutes depending on drive speed

OPTION 2: Clean venv and Reinstall Only Production Dependencies
  - Delete venv (919 MB)
  - Rebuild with: pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
  - Space recovered: ~400-500 MB (development tools removed)

OPTION 3: Delete Frontend Node Modules (Regenerate on Demand)
  - Delete frontend/node_modules (31 MB)
  - Restore with: cd frontend && npm install
  - Space recovered: 31 MB (regenerable)

RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
  1. Archive sounds/ and samples/ to external drive (primary priority)
  2. Delete frontend/node_modules (easily regenerated)
  3. Keep venv for development (can optimize later if needed)

Expected results: Free up 5.1+ GB of local storage space
