## Key Translation Patterns

### Artist Reference → Multiple Query Angles

For any artist, generate queries covering:
1. **Direct reference**: "[Artist] style sample pack"
2. **Genre + descriptors**: "[Genre] [texture] samples"
3. **Source material**: "[What they sample] samples"
4. **Technical/gear**: "[Gear/technique] samples"
5. **Mood + era**: "[Mood] [era] samples"

### Common Translation Rules

| Artist Says... | Translate To... |
|----------------|-----------------|
| MPC workflow | "MPC samples", "boom bap", "chopped" |
| Vinyl aesthetic | "dusty", "vinyl texture", "lo-fi", "warm" |
| Rare records | "obscure", "rare groove", specific regions |
| Dark sound | "dark", minor keys, "atmospheric" |
| Clean/polished | "professional", "WAV", "high quality" |
| Experimental | "glitch", "abstract", "textured", "IDM" |

### Avoiding Over-Specification

❌ Too specific (won't find results):
- "J Dilla MPC 3000 quantize 16% swing neo-soul samples"

✓ Balanced specificity (finds results):
- "J Dilla style samples neo soul"
- "MPC samples dusty jazz"

### Using Artist Pairs

Pair similar artists to broaden results:
- "Madlib Dilla style loops"
- "Nujabes Dilla type samples"
- "Metro Boomin Southside style 808"

This helps YouTube's recommendation algorithm while staying on-target.
