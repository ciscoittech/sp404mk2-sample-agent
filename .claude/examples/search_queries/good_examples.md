# Good Search Query Examples

## Purpose
This file demonstrates effective search query generation with complete reasoning for each example. Use these as templates when generating queries for similar user requests.

## Example 1: Artist Style Reference

### User Request
"I need that Dilla bounce"

### Analysis
**What "Dilla bounce" means:**
- J Dilla = Legendary Detroit hip-hop producer
- "Bounce" = His signature off-beat, MPC-style timing
- Musical characteristics:
  - Off-grid drum programming (quantize off or subtle swing)
  - Neo-soul and jazz sample influence
  - MPC workflow (chops, pads, quantize feel)
  - Warm, lo-fi aesthetic
  - BPM: Typically 85-95 (boom-bap range)

**User is actually seeking:**
- Drum samples with MPC character
- Neo-soul and jazz loops to chop
- Samples that have that "off" timing quality
- Warm, vintage-sounding material

### Generated Queries

✅ **Query 1:** "J Dilla drum kit samples MPC"
**Why this works:**
- Direct artist reference (J Dilla)
- Specific format (drum kit)
- Tool reference (MPC) - important to his sound
- YouTube algorithm knows this combination

✅ **Query 2:** "neo soul samples 90 BPM vinyl texture"
**Why this works:**
- Genre Dilla sampled from (neo-soul)
- Specific BPM in his range
- "vinyl texture" captures the lo-fi warmth
- Multi-angle: genre + BPM + texture

✅ **Query 3:** "Detroit hip hop drum breaks"
**Why this works:**
- Geographic reference (Detroit scene)
- Genre-specific
- "Drum breaks" is what producers search for
- Captures the regional sound

✅ **Query 4:** "Madlib Dilla style loops sample pack"
**Why this works:**
- Pairs Dilla with similar artist (Madlib)
- "Style" makes it clear we want samples, not beats
- "Loops" and "sample pack" are YouTube-friendly terms
- Broadens results while staying on-target

✅ **Query 5:** "dusty jazz samples for hip hop"
**Why this works:**
- "Dusty" captures the lo-fi aesthetic
- "Jazz" is key source material for Dilla
- "for hip hop" clarifies use case
- Common search pattern on YouTube

### What NOT to do

❌ **Bad Query:** "Dilla beats"
**Why it fails:**
- Returns finished beats, not samples to make beats with
- Too vague (which aspect of Dilla's sound?)
- Doesn't specify what format (drums? loops? full beats?)

❌ **Bad Query:** "off-beat drum samples with swing"
**Why it fails:**
- Too technical/abstract
- Most sample packs don't describe themselves this way
- Missing the cultural context (J Dilla reference works better)

❌ **Bad Query:** "MPC 3000 quantize off samples"
**Why it fails:**
- Too equipment-specific
- "Quantize off" is not how people tag samples
- Overly narrow

## Key Patterns Across Good Examples

### Common Success Factors

1. **2-4 Core Terms Per Query**
   - Sweet spot: Not too simple, not overloaded
   - Example: "jazz samples vintage 70s" (3 terms)

2. **Always Include Sample Indicators**
   - "samples", "sample pack", "loops", "breaks", "kit"
   - Crucial for YouTube algorithm

3. **Front-Load Important Terms**
   - Most important term first
   - Example: "boom bap drum samples" not "samples for boom bap drums"

4. **Use Cultural References**
   - Artist names work better than describing their sound
   - Example: "J Dilla style" > "off-beat neo-soul drums"

5. **Multiple Angles on Same Intent**
   - Direct reference: "Madlib sample pack"
   - Genre: "dusty jazz samples"
   - Era: "vintage soul loops"
   - All target same aesthetic, different discovery paths

6. **Include Quality/Format Indicators**
   - "WAV", "high quality", "professional", "free download"
   - Helps filter results

7. **Balance Specificity**
   - Specific enough to be relevant
   - Broad enough to return results
   - Example: "70s soul breaks" not "1973 Memphis soul drum breaks"

### Query Formula Templates

```
[Artist] + style + samples
→ "J Dilla style samples"

[Genre] + [Era] + [Element] + samples
→ "jazz 70s piano samples"

[BPM] + [Genre] + [Element] + kit/pack
→ "90 BPM boom bap drum kit"

[Texture] + [Genre] + loops
→ "dusty soul loops"

[Style] + electronic + samples + [Format]
→ "experimental electronic samples WAV"
```

## Using These Examples

1. **Read the analysis section** to understand the thinking
2. **Note the multi-angle approach** (multiple queries per request)
3. **Apply the patterns** to new requests
4. **Use the "What NOT to do"** to avoid common mistakes
5. **Remember:** Good queries balance specificity with discoverability

These examples should serve as templates for generating effective search queries that actually find relevant, high-quality samples on YouTube.
