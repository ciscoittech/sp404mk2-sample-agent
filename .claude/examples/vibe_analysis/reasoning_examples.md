# Vibe Analysis Reasoning Examples

## Purpose
This file demonstrates complete reasoning processes for vibe analysis. Each example shows the 5-step thinking protocol in action with full reasoning chains.

---

## Example 1: Classic 90s Boom Bap Break

### Input Data
```
Filename: 90s_boom_bap_break_01.wav
BPM: 93
Key: D minor
Spectral Centroid: 1200 Hz
```

### Complete Reasoning Process

**STEP 1: Analyze Musical Characteristics**
```
BPM Analysis:
- 93 BPM falls perfectly in the boom-bap sweet spot (85-100 BPM)
- This is mid-tempo: groovy but not lazy, purposeful but not frantic
- Ideal for verse sections and main loops

Key Analysis:
- D minor is a serious, somewhat dark key
- Not depressing, but definitely not cheerful
- Suggests contemplative, focused mood
- Common in hip-hop for its gravitas

Spectral Centroid:
- 1200 Hz is warm, mid-focused
- Indicates analog character, not bright digital
- Suggests live drums or well-sampled breaks
- No harsh high-end, comfortable listening

Filename Clues:
- "90s_boom_bap" confirms era and style
- "Break" indicates drum-focused, loop-able
- Likely sourced from or emulating 90s production
```

**STEP 2: Consider Era and Production Context**
```
Era Indicators:
- 93 BPM + D minor + warm spectrum = classic 90s aesthetic
- Boom bap emerged from late 80s, peaked in early-mid 90s
- This BPM/texture combo is signature golden era hip-hop

Production Techniques:
- Likely sampled from vinyl (warm spectrum supports this)
- MPC or SP-1200 aesthetic (industry standard for boom bap)
- Minimal processing (characteristic of 90s hip-hop production)
- Possible subtle compression, but not heavily processed

Gear Context:
- MPC 60/3000 were dominant in this era
- SP-1200 was coveted for its gritty texture
- Akai S950 also popular
- All these samplers had 12-bit character (warm, slightly gritty)

Genre Movement:
- Golden era hip-hop (roughly 1988-1997)
- East Coast boom bap aesthetic
- Influenced by jazz, soul, and funk sampling
- Artists: Nas, Mobb Deep, Wu-Tang, Gang Starr, etc.
```

**STEP 3: Identify Mood and Emotional Qualities**
```
Energy Level:
- Medium energy (BPM 93 is moderate)
- Not chill/laid-back (that would be <85 BPM)
- Not aggressive/intense (that would be >100 BPM)
- Energy rating: MEDIUM

Emotional Valence:
- D minor suggests darker/serious tone
- But not oppressively dark
- Reflective, thoughtful, purposeful
- The warmth (1200 Hz) softens the minor key
- Overall: Serious but not depressing

Texture Quality:
- Warm (spectral centroid)
- Likely has slight grit (boom bap aesthetic)
- Organic (analog character)
- Dusty (90s sampling aesthetic)
- Texture rating: Warm, dusty, organic

Movement Character:
- Rhythmic (it's a break)
- Forward-moving (typical of boom bap)
- Groove-oriented (93 BPM has pocket)
- Not static, not frantic
- Movement: Steady groove

Mood Synthesis:
- Purposeful: The tempo and key create intentionality
- Grounded: Warm mid-range keeps it earthy
- Nostalgic: 90s aesthetic triggers familiarity
- Reflective: Minor key adds contemplation
- Urban: Boom bap = city streets aesthetic
```

**STEP 4: Determine Best Use Case**
```
Primary Use Analysis:
- BPM 93 = perfect for verse drums or main loop
- Drum break = rhythmic foundation element
- Warm character = won't clash with melodic layers
- → Best use: DRUM FOUNDATION

Secondary Uses:
- Could work for chorus if kept simple
- Good for verse/hook contrast
- Works as B-section in arrangements
- Could be chopped for fills and transitions

Producer Workflow Integration:
- SP-404MK2 context: Load in pad bank 1-4
- Use as loop foundation
- Layer with bass in same key (D minor)
- Add melodic elements in mid-high range
- Keep clean or add vinyl texture for more dust

Genre Applications:
- Hip-hop: Primary genre (boom bap, conscious rap)
- Lo-fi: Works well (already has vintage character)
- Neo-soul: Good for grounded, rhythmic tracks
- Trip-hop: Suitable for mid-tempo atmospheric pieces

What NOT to use this for:
- Trap/drill (too slow, wrong aesthetic)
- House/techno (wrong BPM, wrong style)
- Pop (too gritty, too niche)
- Ambient (too rhythmically prominent)
```

**STEP 5: Identify Compatibility and Complementary Samples**
```
BPM Compatibility:
- Exact match: 90-96 BPM samples
- Half-time: 45-48 BPM (for atmospheric layers)
- Double-time: 186 BPM (for hi-hat variations)
- → Target BPM range: 90-96 for main elements

Key Compatibility:
- Same key: D minor (safest choice)
- Relative major: F major (harmonically related)
- Parallel major: D major (for brightness contrast)
- Fifth: A minor (strong harmonic relationship)
- → Target keys: D minor, F major, A minor

Era/Texture Compatibility:
- Other 90s samples (aesthetic cohesion)
- Vinyl-sourced samples (texture match)
- Jazz/soul samples (genre origin)
- Lo-fi samples (complementary processing)

Frequency Compatibility:
- This sample: Warm mid-range (1200 Hz focus)
- Need: Sub-bass (40-80 Hz) - no frequency clash
- Need: High melodic elements (2-8 kHz) - fills空白 space
- Avoid: Dense mid-range samples (frequency masking)

Role Compatibility:
- This is drums (rhythmic foundation)
- Complement with: Bass (low-end support)
- Complement with: Melody (high-mid range)
- Complement with: Texture (ambient, subtle)
- Avoid: Other prominent drum loops (rhythmic clash)

Specific Recommendations:
✓ Jazz basslines, 90-95 BPM, D minor
✓ Dusty piano chords, F major, atmospheric
✓ Vinyl crackle texture, continuous
✓ Soul vocal samples, D minor, sparse
✓ Muted trumpet riffs, mid-high range
✗ Bright synthesizers (aesthetic clash)
✗ Fast hi-hats (tempo mismatch)
✗ Heavy 808s (era clash)
```

### Final Output

## Example 2: Modern Lo-Fi Piano Sample

### Input Data
```
Filename: lofi_piano_cmaj_slow.wav
BPM: 75
Key: C major
Spectral Centroid: 1800 Hz
```

### Complete Reasoning Process

**STEP 1: Analyze Musical Characteristics**
```
BPM Analysis:
- 75 BPM is slow/laid-back
- This is chill territory (below 80 BPM)
- Perfect for lo-fi, study beats, downtempo
- Too slow for most boom bap (that's 85-100)

Key Analysis:
- C major is bright, positive, open
- Not dark or melancholic
- Suggests uplifting or neutral mood
- Very versatile key (no accidentals)

Spectral Centroid:
- 1800 Hz is higher than typical (warm is <1500 Hz)
- Indicates piano presence in upper mid-range
- Not harsh bright (that would be >2500 Hz)
- Pleasant, airy quality

Instrument Clues:
- "Piano" in filename confirms instrument
- Piano in 1800 Hz range = melodic playing, not bass
- "Lofi" suggests intentional imperfection
- "Slow" confirms the BPM assessment
```

**STEP 2: Consider Era and Production Context**
```
Era Indicators:
- "Lo-fi" is modern genre (2010s-present)
- But aesthetic borrows from vintage
- Modern production with vintage textures
- Not trying to sound 90s, but warm/nostalgic

Production Techniques:
- Intentional degradation (tape saturation, bit crushing)
- Vinyl crackle likely added
- Possibly pitched/time-stretched
- Reverb for space (common in lo-fi)
- EQ'd for warmth (reduced harsh highs)

Aesthetic Context:
- Lo-fi hip-hop / chillhop / study beats genre
- YouTube/streaming culture (background music)
- Influenced by: J Dilla, Nujabes, modern bedroom producers
- Emphasizes mood over technical perfection

Genre Movement:
- Lo-fi hip-hop boom (2015-present)
- "Beats to study/relax to" phenomenon
- Bedroom producer aesthetic
- DIY, accessible production style
```

**STEP 3: Identify Mood and Emotional Qualities**
```
Energy Level:
- Low energy (75 BPM is slow)
- Relaxed, not driving
- Background-suitable
- Chill, laid-back vibe
- Energy rating: LOW

Emotional Valence:
- C major = positive/neutral
- Slow tempo softens the brightness
- Result: Calm, peaceful, gentle
- Not ecstatic (too slow), not sad (major key)
- Overall: Comforting, warm, peaceful

Texture Quality:
- Airy (1800 Hz presence)
- Lo-fi = intentionally imperfect
- Warm despite higher centroid (production choice)
- Intimate (lo-fi aesthetic)
- Texture: Soft, airy, slightly gritty

Movement Character:
- Flowing (piano arpeggios or chords?)
- Not rhythmic (it's melodic)
- Gentle, continuous
- Ambient quality
- Movement: Flowing, atmospheric

Mood Synthesis:
- Peaceful: Slow + major + soft = calm
- Nostalgic: Lo-fi aesthetic = memories
- Intimate: Bedroom producer vibe = personal
- Comforting: Warm + gentle = safe
- Introspective: Slow + piano = thought
```

**STEP 4: Determine Best Use Case**
```
Primary Use Analysis:
- Piano = melodic element
- 75 BPM = too slow for most drums (use as melodic layer)
- C major = versatile harmonic foundation
- → Best use: MELODIC LAYER or HARMONIC BED

Secondary Uses:
- Could be main hook/riff
- Background texture under vocals
- Intro/outro atmospheric element
- Bridge section for contrast

Producer Workflow:
- SP-404MK2: Load in melodic bank
- Layer over drums (drums should be 70-80 BPM)
- Add bass in C major scale
- Keep minimal (lo-fi is sparse)
- Add vinyl crackle if not already present

Genre Applications:
- Lo-fi hip-hop: Primary genre (perfect fit)
- Chillhop: Ideal (core element)
- Study beats: Excellent (non-intrusive)
- Neo-soul: Works (especially for intro/bridge)
- Ambient: Suitable (atmospheric quality)

What NOT to use this for:
- Fast genres (trap, drill, drum & bass) - tempo mismatch
- Dark/aggressive tracks - mood mismatch
- Boom bap - too slow, wrong aesthetic
- Dance music - not driving enough
```

**STEP 5: Identify Compatibility and Complementary Samples**
```
BPM Compatibility:
- Exact: 70-80 BPM samples
- Avoid: >100 BPM (too fast for this vibe)
- → Target: 70-80 BPM for rhythmic elements

Key Compatibility:
- Same key: C major (easiest)
- Relative minor: A minor (common in lo-fi)
- Subdominant: F major (smooth progression)
- Dominant: G major (tension/release)
- → Target keys: C major, A minor, F major

Frequency Compatibility:
- This sample: Upper mid (1800 Hz)
- Need: Sub-bass (40-80 Hz) - low end
- Need: Drums (varies, but avoid mid-range snares)
- Good: Subtle high-end (vinyl crackle, air)
- Avoid: Other piano/melodic in same range (masking)

Role Compatibility:
- This is melody/harmony (foreground)
- Complement with: Drums (foundation, sparse)
- Complement with: Bass (sub-bass, simple)
- Complement with: Texture (vinyl, rain, tape noise)
- Avoid: Complex melodies (keep it minimal)

Lo-Fi Specific Compatibility:
- Seek: Dusty drums (70-80 BPM)
- Seek: Warm bass (simple, sub-focused)
- Seek: Jazz samples (chord progressions)
- Seek: Vinyl textures (crackle, hiss)
- Seek: Nature sounds (rain, cafe ambience)

Specific Recommendations:
✓ Lo-fi drum loop, 75 BPM, minimal
✓ Sub-bass, C note, simple pattern
✓ Vinyl crackle texture, continuous
✓ Rain ambience, subtle background
✓ Jazz guitar, C major, sparse
✗ Aggressive 808s (vibe mismatch)
✗ Fast hi-hats (tempo/vibe clash)
✗ Bright synths (aesthetic clash)
```

## Example 3: Dark Trap Bass Sample

### Input Data
```
Filename: dark_808_bass_em.wav
BPM: 140
Key: E minor
Spectral Centroid: 400 Hz
```

### Complete Reasoning Process

**STEP 1: Analyze Musical Characteristics**
```
BPM Analysis:
- 140 BPM is fast (trap territory)
- Trap is often 140-160 BPM (or felt as 70-80 in half-time)
- This is high-energy, driving tempo
- Could be drill, trap, or modern hip-hop

Key Analysis:
- E minor is dark, tense
- Common in trap/drill (dark aesthetic)
- One sharp (F#), relatively simple
- Menacing, serious mood

Spectral Centroid:
- 400 Hz is LOW (sub-bass/bass range)
- This is felt more than heard
- Indicates sub-bass focus, not melodic bass
- Classic 808 territory (30-400 Hz)

Filename Clues:
- "Dark" confirms aesthetic
- "808" confirms instrument (TR-808 bass)
- "Bass" confirms role
- E minor specified = pitched 808
```

**STEP 2: Consider Era and Production Context**
```
Era Indicators:
- 140 BPM + 808 + dark = modern trap (2010s-present)
- Could be trap, drill, or modern hip-hop
- Not 90s (808 used differently then)
- Contemporary production

Production Techniques:
- 808 typically processed with:
  - Distortion/saturation (adds harmonics)
  - Compression (sustain/power)
  - Sidechain to kick (if present)
- Low spectral centroid = pure sub focus
- Likely mono or centered bass

Aesthetic Context:
- Trap: Atlanta trap, dark melodic
- Drill: Chicago/UK drill, aggressive
- Modern hip-hop: Post-trap influence
- Emphasis: Power, darkness, aggression

Reference Artists:
- Metro Boomin, Southside, 808 Mafia (trap)
- Chief Keef, Pop Smoke (drill)
- Travis Scott, Future (modern trap)
```

**STEP 3: Identify Mood and Emotional Qualities**
```
Energy Level:
- High energy (140 BPM)
- But felt in half-time (70 BPM feel)
- Bass energy: POWERFUL
- Overall: HIGH ENERGY

Emotional Valence:
- E minor + low bass = DARK
- Not sad, but menacing
- Aggressive, tense
- Urban, street aesthetic
- Valence: Dark, aggressive

Texture Quality:
- Heavy (low frequency mass)
- Thick (sub-bass presence)
- Powerful (808 character)
- Could be distorted (adds aggression)
- Texture: Heavy, thick, powerful

Movement Character:
- Rhythmic (bass pattern)
- Driving (high BPM)
- Pulsing (808 envelope)
- Not subtle or flowing
- Movement: Aggressive, driving

Mood Synthesis:
- Menacing: Dark + heavy + aggressive
- Powerful: Sub-bass + 140 BPM = force
- Urban: Trap/drill = street aesthetic
- Tense: E minor + fast = anxiety
- Intense: All factors combine for impact
```

**STEP 4: Determine Best Use Case**
```
Primary Use Analysis:
- 808 = bass foundation
- 140 BPM = trap/drill primary tempo
- E minor = dark melodic context
- → Best use: BASS FOUNDATION

Secondary Uses:
- Could be main hook (repetitive 808 pattern)
- Drop element (impactful moment)
- Verse foundation
- Not suitable for subtle or background use

Producer Workflow:
- SP-404MK2: Load in bass bank
- Pair with hard-hitting drums (808 kick + snare)
- Add dark melodic elements (E minor)
- Add fast hi-hats (trap signature)
- Keep arrangement sparse (let bass dominate)

Genre Applications:
- Trap: Primary genre (perfect fit)
- Drill: Ideal (dark + aggressive)
- Modern hip-hop: Works (post-trap influence)
- Grime: Suitable (UK bass music)
- Not suitable for: Lo-fi, boom bap, soul, jazz

What NOT to use this for:
- Chill genres (too aggressive)
- Vintage aesthetics (too modern)
- Bright/happy tracks (dark vibe)
- Slow tempos <100 BPM (except half-time trap)
```

**STEP 5: Identify Compatibility and Complementary Samples**
```
BPM Compatibility:
- Exact: 140 BPM (trap time)
- Half-time feel: Drums can be 70 BPM feel
- Avoid: Anything <100 BPM (except half-time)
- → Target: 140 BPM or half-time 70 BPM

Key Compatibility:
- Same key: E minor (safest)
- Relative major: G major (brightness contrast)
- Parallel major: E major (uncommon in trap)
- Fifth: B minor (dark, compatible)
- → Target: E minor, G major, B minor

Frequency Compatibility:
- This sample: Sub-bass (400 Hz and below)
- Need: Kick drum (50-100 Hz transient) - careful mixing
- Need: Hi-hats (8-15 kHz) - fills high end
- Need: Snare (200 Hz + 4 kHz) - mid-high
- Avoid: Other bass (frequency clash)

Role Compatibility:
- This is bass (low-end foundation)
- Complement with: Hard drums (808 kick, snappy snare)
- Complement with: Fast hi-hats (trap signature)
- Complement with: Dark melodies (E minor, sparse)
- Avoid: Other bass samples (masking/mud)

Trap-Specific Compatibility:
- Seek: 808 kick (50-80 Hz, short decay)
- Seek: Snappy snare (high transient)
- Seek: Fast hi-hat rolls (trap staple)
- Seek: Dark pads/bells (E minor, atmospheric)
- Avoid: Bright/happy elements

Specific Recommendations:
✓ 808 kick, 140 BPM, short decay
✓ Snappy snare, layered, reverb
✓ Fast hi-hat rolls, 32nd notes
✓ Dark synth pad, E minor, atmospheric
✓ Vocal tags, aggressive, sparse
✗ Acoustic drums (aesthetic clash)
✗ Warm bass (frequency clash)
✗ Bright melodies (mood clash)
```

## Key Patterns Across Examples

### Common Reasoning Structures

1. **BPM → Genre/Energy**
   - 70-80 BPM = Lo-fi, chill, low energy
   - 85-100 BPM = Boom bap, medium energy
   - 140+ BPM = Trap/drill, high energy (or half-time)

2. **Key → Emotional Valence**
   - Minor keys = Darker, more serious
   - Major keys = Brighter, more positive
   - Context matters (slow major can be peaceful, fast major can be happy)

3. **Spectral Centroid → Tonal Character**
   - <1000 Hz = Dark, bass-heavy
   - 1000-1500 Hz = Warm, analog
   - 1500-2500 Hz = Bright, airy
   - >2500 Hz = Very bright, potentially harsh

4. **Always Connect**
   - Technical data → Musical meaning
   - Musical characteristics → Producer use case
   - Individual elements → Complete picture

### Avoiding Common Mistakes

❌ **Don't skip the reasoning**
```
Bad: "93 BPM, D minor → boom bap"
Good: "93 BPM is mid-tempo, typical of boom bap (85-100 BPM range).
       D minor adds serious, contemplative mood. Combined with warm
       spectral character, this suggests 90s golden era hip-hop aesthetic."
```

❌ **Don't ignore context clues**
```
Bad: Analyzing "lofi_piano" as if it's acoustic piano recording
Good: "Lo-fi" in name indicates intentional aesthetic - expect
       degradation, vinyl textures, bedroom producer vibe
```

❌ **Don't make era anachronisms**
```
Bad: "70s sample with 808 bass"
Good: "70s sample with live bass" OR "80s+ sample with 808 bass"
```

❌ **Don't give generic mood descriptors**
```
Bad: mood = ["good", "nice", "cool"]
Good: mood = ["purposeful", "nostalgic", "grounded"]
```

## Using These Examples

1. **Study the reasoning chains** - see how conclusions are reached
2. **Note the connections** between technical data and musical meaning
3. **Observe the structure** - 5 steps are always followed
4. **Apply the patterns** to new samples
5. **Remember**: Explicit reasoning makes better analysis

These examples demonstrate that good vibe analysis comes from systematic thinking, not intuition alone.
