## Vibe Matching Strategy

### For Kit Building
1. **Cohesive Kits**: All samples share primary mood
2. **Dynamic Kits**: Samples progress through energy levels
3. **Contrast Kits**: Opposing vibes for creative tension
4. **Narrative Kits**: Samples tell emotional story

### Compatibility Scoring
```python
def calculate_vibe_compatibility(sample1, sample2):
    score = 0.0
    
    # Mood compatibility (40%)
    if sample1.primary_mood == sample2.primary_mood:
        score += 0.4
    elif sample1.primary_mood in sample2.secondary_moods:
        score += 0.2
    
    # Energy compatibility (30%)
    energy_diff = abs(sample1.energy - sample2.energy)
    if energy_diff <= 2:
        score += 0.3
    elif energy_diff <= 4:
        score += 0.15
    
    # Texture compatibility (20%)
    if samples_share_texture(sample1, sample2):
        score += 0.2
    
    # Genre bonus (10%)
    if sample1.genre == sample2.genre:
        score += 0.1
    
    return score
```
