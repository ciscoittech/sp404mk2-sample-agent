Playing back samples (SAMPLE MODE)
Hold down the [SHIFT] button and press the bank [A/F]–[E/J] buttons.
The BANK VOLUME screen appears.
Turn the [VALUE] knob to set the bank volume.
To finish making settings, press the [EXIT] button.

## Memo

You may notice a difference in playback volume when copying or exchanging samples between different banks, due to the differences in the BANK
VOLUME parameters set for each bank.
Playing back a sample to the tempo of a song (BPM SYNC)
You can synchronize the tempo (playback speed) of one sample with another sample.
You can also synchronize the tempo of a sample with that of an external device that’s playing, such as a musical instrument or computer.
Press the [BPM SYNC] button.
This turns BPM SYNC on. The tempo of the sample then synchronizes with the bank tempo or the project tempo. The playback speed is
adjusted so that the sample plays back at the right tempo.

## Memo

Set which tempo is used as the sample’s base tempo for playback in the system parameters.
For details, refer to “Parameter guide (p. 121)”.
To use BPM SYNC, you must first set the accurate tempo data for each sample.
For details, refer to “Setting the tempo data in a sample (p. 81)”.
You can make BPM SYNC synchronize either to the bank tempo or to the project tempo.
For details, refer to “Setting the tempo for a bank or project (p. 83)”.
To turn the BPM SYNC parameter on/off for all samples in a bank, press the [BPM SYNC] button while holding down the [SHIFT] button.
Playing back only while a pad is pressed (GATE)
This switches the gate function on/off.
When the [GATE] button is on, samples play back only while the pads are pressed (gate playback).
When the [GATE] button is off, samples begin playing back each time a pad is pressed.

## Memo

You can also use the gate function with the [EXT SOURCE] button.
When the [GATE] button is turned on, the sound from the external device is output only while you are pressing the [EXT SOURCE] button.
When the [GATE] button is turned off, the sound from the external device is switched on/off each time you press the [EXT SOURCE] button.

Playing back samples only one time (One-shot Playback)
When the sample playback mode is set to one-shot playback, the sample plays back once to the end when you press a pad.
The pad’s operations are disabled (ignored) until playback is finished.
Even if a phrase that’s shorter than the sample length is recorded in a pattern, the sample plays back to the end without returning to the beginning
(no retriggering).
This characteristic is useful for playing a long sample as a backing track.
Hold down the [VALUE] knob and press the [GATE] button.
This sets the sample playback mode to “one-shot playback”.
The [GATE] button blinks slowly at this time.

## Memo

The loop function turns off (and the [LOOP] button goes dark) when one-shot playback is on.
Playing back samples repeatedly (LOOP)
Use the loop function to make a sample play back repeatedly. The loop settings can be made per sample.
When the [LOOP] button is turned on, the loop switches between playback and stopping with each press of the pad (trigger playback).
When the [LOOP] button is off, samples play back from the beginning each time a pad is pressed.

## Memo

When you hold down the [HOLD] button and press a pad (sample) whose loop is turned on, the sample plays back from the beginning (retrigger).
In this case, pressing the pad does not make the sample stop.
Samples that are playing back in a loop play back from the beginning, making it sound like the loop was momentarily canceled.
Setting the loop to play back forwards
Press the [LOOP] button to turn the loop on (the button lights up).
The loop plays back forwards.
Setting the loop to play back in reverse
Press the [LOOP] button to turn the loop on (the button lights up).

Playing back samples (SAMPLE MODE)
Muting the playback of a sample (Pad MUTE)
You can momentarily mute (silence) the playback of a sample.
By using part mute on a sample that’s playing back, you can create a break.

## Memo

When a pattern is selected (the pad lights up purple), the pad can’t be muted. To mute a pad, press the [PATTERN SELECT] button and switch to
sample mode (the pad lights up orange).
Press a pad to play its sample.
Hold down the [SHIFT] button and [REVERSE] button and press the pad (sample) you want to mute.
The pad (sample) is muted. Muted pads (samples) light up red.
You can mute individual samples, either one or more than one, or mute individual samples when a pattern is playing back.

## Memo

If you press the [REVERSE] and [REMAIN] buttons while holding down the [SHIFT] button, the [SHIFT] and [REVERSE] buttons remain in a pressed-
down state, even after you take your fingers off the buttons.
This makes it easier to mute or unmute multiple pads. Press the [EXIT] button to cancel this behavior.
To unmute a pad, hold down the [SHIFT] button and [REVERSE] button and press the pad (sample) you want to unmute.

## Memo

You can also unmute a pad by pressing the [EXIT] button four times to stop the sample playback.

## Memo

When Pad MUTE (SYSTEM parameter) is set to “MASTER,” the sound of the pad can be output from the PHONES jack, even if the pad (sample) is
muted (this lets you monitor the sounds from the pads). In this case, no effects are applied.
Refer to the “Pad MUTE (p. 121)” SYSTEM parameter for details.
Playing back multiple pads at the same time (PAD LINK GROUPS)
The PAD LINK GROUPS function lets you group multiple pads (up to four) into one group. By setting a group ahead of time, you can make all the
pads in the group play back just by operating a single pad within that group.
You can also register up to 10 groups (A–J).
Hold down the [SHIFT] button and press the pad [7].
The PAD LINK GROUPS screen appears.
Turn the [VALUE] knob to select the group (A-J).
Press pads [1]–[16] to select the samples you want to include in the group.
To finish making settings, press the [EXIT] button.
Press one of the pads that you set in the group.
All the pads in the group play back at the same time.
Merging multiple samples into a single sample (SAMPLE MERGE)
You can combine multiple samples that are assigned to different pads into a single pad.
Playing back samples (SAMPLE MODE)
While holding down the [SHIFT] button, press [RESAMPLE] button.
Press pads [1]–[16] to select more than one sample that you want to merge (up to four).
Turn the knobs listed below to configure the merge processing, and press the [VALUE] knob to execute.
Knob
Explanation
[CTRL 1] knob
This selects the merge processing method.

## Sum

Sums (adds) the samples together.
This lets you mix and combine the samples that are assigned to
different pads into a single pad.
You can use this sum merge processing to make more empty
pads, if there are no more pads available for assigning samples.

## Mul

Multiplies the samples.
For instance, if you have an audio sample on one pad and a
sample with a recorded waveform on another pad, this
processing modulates the sound of the first pad with the
waveform of the second pad.
You can liberally use this multiplicative processing to create your
own sounds.
[CTRL3] knob
Sets the volume of each pad to be used for the merge operation.
If this value is too large, the merged results may sound distorted.
[VALUE] knob
Selects the pad for which you want to set the volume.
Press pads [1]–[16] to select the save destination pad, and press the [VALUE] knob.
The samples are merged, and the result is saved in the selected pad.
Preventing samples from playing back at the same time (MUTE GROUP)
The MUTE GROUP function lets you group together all the samples that should not play at the same time (in other words, the samples you don’t
want to layer).
When you try and play the samples within that group all at the same time, only the sample that started playing back last is heard.
A group can consist of up to 16 samples. You can also register up to 10 groups (groups A–J).
Hold down the [SHIFT] button and press the pad [8].
The MUTE GROUP screen appears.
Turn the [VALUE] knob to select the group (A-J).
Press pads [1]–[16] to select the samples you want to include in the group.
To finish making settings, press the [EXIT] button.
Out of the pads (samples) in the same group, sound is played back only for the last pad you play.
Playing back samples (SAMPLE MODE)
Stopping all sample playback (STOP)
You can make all samples and patterns that are currently playing back stop.
Press the [EXIT] button quickly four times.
All samples and patterns that are playing back stop.

## Memo

You can also press the [EXIT] button while holding down the [SHIFT] button to stop all samples and patterns that are playing back.
Pausing the sound of a sample (PAUSE)
Pauses the sample that’s currently playing back.
Hold down the [SHIFT] button and press the [HOLD] button.
All samples that are playing back pause.
Hold down the [SHIFT] button and press the [HOLD] button again to resume playback.
The samples resume playback.
Disabling buttons that are not used when playing live (LIVE MODE)
Normally, the buttons related to features like sampling and editing are not used when you are playing live.
Accidentally pressing these buttons while you’re performing live might be a show-stopper.
By turning live mode on, you can disable these buttons and avoid such accidents.
