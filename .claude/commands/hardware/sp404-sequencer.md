Combining samples to create a pattern (PATTERN

## Sequencer)

You can record the order in which the samples play back, so that multiple samples play back at the timing you choose. The data in which the
playback order is recorded is called a “pattern”.
In this section, we explain how the patterns are played back and how to create (record) them.
Playing a pattern
This shows you how to recall a pattern, which contains the sample playback order, and play it back.
Press the [PATTERN SELECT] button.
The SELECT screen appears.
BPM of the pattern
Pads to which patterns are assigned light up purple.
Press pads [1]–[16].
This plays back the pattern.
When you press the other pads [1]–[16] while the pattern is playing back, this places the next pattern to play back in standby. When the
currently playing pattern has finished playing, the next pattern starts playing.
To stop the pattern playback, press the pad that’s playing back (pads [1]–[16]; lit white) or press the [EXIT] button.

## Memo

If you hold down the [SUB PAD] button and press a [1]–[16] pad, the pattern will change immediately.
Press pads [1]–[16] while holding down the [VALUE] knob to select a pattern (the pattern does not play back at this time).
You can press the [REC] button while a pattern is playing back to switch to real-time pattern recording. Note that recording starts at the top of
the first measure of the pattern. If you’ve pressed the [REC] button while the pattern is playing, the message “Wait for REC” appears.
You can switch to pattern TR-REC by pressing the [REC] button while holding down the [SHIFT] button during pattern playback.
You can turns the metronome sound on/off by pressing pad [9] while holding down the [SHIFT] button during pattern playback.
You can access the UTILITY MENU screen while the pattern is stopped.
Creating a new pattern (real-time recording)
Here’s how to create a pattern by recording what you play on the keyboard and how you operate the controllers, just as-is.
Press the [PATTERN SELECT] button.
Press the [REC] button.
Empty pads in which no patterns have been recorded blink red.

When the player presses a pad to play
back a sample, the timing inevitably
varies.
Quantization is a function that
automatically corrects these
inconsistencies in timing when you
record a pattern.
When quantization is set, you can record
patterns in which the notes sound within
specified intervals.

## Memo

While you’re recording a pattern, the unit switches between rehearsal and recording mode each time you press the [REC] button. When in
rehearsal mode, loop playback continues for the recorded pattern without being recorded. This function is useful when you want to practice
recording a pattern.
You can press the [REC] button while a pattern is playing back to switch to pattern recording. Note that recording starts at the beginning of the
pattern. If you’ve pressed the [REC] button in the middle of the pattern, the message “Wait for REC” appears.
While the pattern is recording, press the [PATTERN SELECT] button while holding down the [SHIFT] button to undo the data you just inputted
(recorded). This is useful when you made a mistake in timing when recording a pattern.
If you press the [RECORD SETTING] button while the pattern is recording or during rehearsal mode, the RECORD SETTING screen is shown. Note
that you can’t set the LENGTH parameter at this time. Set the LENGTH parameter before recording a pattern. Press the [EXIT] button to return
to the previous screen.
Press the [DEL] button while recording a pattern to enter erase mode (which lets erase a pattern). The performance data recorded in the
pattern for the pads (samples) [1]–[16] is erased, during the time range that you hold them down. Press the [DEL] button again to return to the
previous screen.
You can also record note messages that are input via the MIDI IN connector and the USB port to a pattern.
When you are finished recording the pattern, press the [EXIT] button twice.
Press the [EXIT] button once to finish recording. The recorded pattern is automatically saved to the pad. Press twice to stop pattern playback.
Adding a count-in before recording a pattern
This feature adds a count-in before the pattern start recording. This gives you time to get ready to play before the pattern actually begins
recording.
Hold down the [SHIFT] button and press the pad [10].
Edit the count-in setting.

Differences between bouncing and resampling
Type
How each type works differently
Bouncing
Converts the entire selected pattern into a sample. No sound is heard while the sample is being converted.
The pattern is converted into a sample without applying effects.
“Converting patterns to samples (BOUNCE) (p. 66)”
Resampling
The selected pattern plays back once it is converted into a sample. You can stop the conversion at a point
you like while listening to the sound.
With resampling, you can convert the pattern with effects applied.

## Str

0–100 (%)
Sets the strength of quantization
used for adjusting the note timing,
as set in the QTZ parameter.
If you’ve selected “GRID” for the
QTZ parameter, a setting of 100%
corrects the note timing to match
the timing set in the QTZ
parameter.
Lower values make the
quantization less obvious, and a
value of 0% results in no
quantization.
If you’ve selected “SHUFFLE” for
the QTZ parameter, a value of 50%
makes the notes play at equal
intervals, and larger values make
the notes play like dotted notes.
