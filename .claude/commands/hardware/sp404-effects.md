Using the effects
You can use the built-in effects on the SP-404MK2 to process the audio in unique ways.
Use the built-in effects on the SP-404MK2 by assigning them to a bus (an audio routing inside the SP-404MK2).
With BUS 1 and BUS 2, you can apply the effects that are appropriate for your performance, per sample. BUS 3 and BUS 4 are mainly used to apply
effects to the overall sound output from the SP-404MK2.
There are two kinds of bus routings (in connection order) that you can select as you like.

Refer to “Configuring the effect routing (p. 104)” for how to edit the bus routings.
To switch between DRY Routing parameters, see “ DRY Routing (p. 128)” in EFX SET.
Adding effects to a sample (BUS FX)
You can use the various effects built into the SP-404MK2 to process the playback audio in unique ways.
Using the effects
Press the effect buttons.
Press the buttons of the effects you want to apply, including the [FILTER+DRIVE] button, the [RESONATOR] button, the [DELAY] button, the
[ISOLATOR] button, the [DJFX LOOPER] button, and the [MFX] button.
This turns the effects on.
Press pads [1]–[16] to play back the samples.
Effects are applied to the samples.
Use the [CTRL 1]–[CTRL 3] knobs to edit the parameters.
The parameters change how the effects are applied.
You can also access the effect sub-parameters by holding down the [VALUE] knob and operating the knobs.

## Memo

You can assign the effects you like to the effect buttons.
For details, refer to “Assigning the desired effect to an effect button (DIRECT FX) (p. 107)”.
Assigning effects to BUS 1 and BUS 2
Here’s how to assign the built-in effects of this unit to BUS 1 or BUS 2. You can use two types of effects separately.
Press the [BUS FX] button to select the bus to configure.
When the button is lit orange, BUS 1 is selected; and when the button is blinking orange, BUS 2 is selected.
Press the [FILTER+DRIVE]–[MFX] buttons to select the effect to assign to the bus.

## Memo

You can assign the built-in effects of this unit to BUS 3 or BUS 4. Up to four effects are available.
To assign an effect to BUS 3 or BUS 4, change the settings in the effect setting screen.
“Configuring the effect settings (EFX SET) (p. 103)”
When you set BUS 1 and BUS 2 to the same effect, the message “Same EFX on other BUS” is shown.
Using the effects
Deciding on effects to use for each sample
Sets which sample playback audio is sent to which bus (meaning which effects are used) for each sample.
In this example, we apply the effect assigned to BUS 2 to the sample on pad [1].

## Memo

Set which effect is applied to the bus beforehand. For details, refer to “Assigning effects to BUS 1 and BUS 2 (p. 28)”.
Press the [BUS FX] button to select BUS 2.
Hold down the [REMAIN] button and press the pad [1].
The playback audio for the sample assigned to pad [1] is sent to the effect assigned to BUS 2.
Pad [1] lights up green at this time.

## Memo

The pad’s color tells you the bus to which the sample is sent.
Pad color
Audio send destination (bus)
Lit orange

## Bus 1

Lit green

## Bus 2

Lit white
The sound is not sent to BUS 1 or BUS 2 (DRY).
Preventing samples from being sent to BUS 1/BUS 2
You can prevent the playback audio of samples from being sent to BUS 1 or BUS 2 (DRY). In this case, no effects are applied to the samples.
While holding down the [REMAIN] button, press the pad [1]–[16] buttons a number of times to make them light up white.
The BUS 1 and BUS 2 effects are not applied to the samples of pads that are lit up white.
Sending the Audio Input from the INPUT Jack to a Bus
As with the samples, you can set the bus to which the playback audio signals coming into the INPUT jack are sent (meaning which effects are used).
For details, refer to “Sending the audio input from the INPUT jack to a bus (p. 109)”.
Using the MFX effects
You can select and use the effects you like for the MFX effects.
While holding down the [MFX] button, turn the [VALUE] knob or the [CTRL 3] knob to select the effect to use.

## Memo

You can also use pads [1]–[16] instead of the [VALUE] knob or the [CTRL 3] knob to select an effect.
To use pads [1]–[16] to select effects from #17 and up, hold down the [MFX] button and press the [DJFX LOOPER] button.
To use pads [1]–[16] to select effects from #33 and up, hold down the [MFX] button and press the [ISOLATOR] button.
Using the effects
After selecting the effect, take your finger off the [MFX] button.
The effect turns on, and the effect edit screen appears.
Play back a sample.
Use the [CTRL 1]–[CTRL 3] knobs to edit the parameter.
You can also access the effect sub-parameters by holding down the [VALUE] knob and operating the knobs.
Editing the effects
When you press an effect button (such as the [FILTER+DRIVE] button) to turn the effect on, the effect edit screen appears.
Turn the [CTRL 1]–[CTRL 3] knobs while the effect edit screen is displayed to edit the main parameters of the effect.
You may be able to access the sub-parameters by holding down the [VALUE] knob, depending on the effect.
Turn the [CTRL 1]–[CTRL 3] knobs to edit the sub-parameters of the effect.
Locking the effect edit screen
Although the effect edit screen displays when you press an effect button, the screen normally returns to the previous screen if you don’t operate
any controls for several seconds.
You can use the following operation if you want to make the effect edit screen keep displaying.
While holding down the [REMAIN] button, press an effect button (such as the [FILTER+DRIVE] button).
The effect edit screen appears. Even if you don’t operate the unit for a while after this, the unit does not return to the previous screen.
The display switches between main parameters and sub-parameters each time you press the [VALUE] knob, depending on the effect.
To exit the settings, press the [EXIT] button or the [REMAIN] button.
How the effect parameters are saved and shared
Parameters that are retained even after you turn off the power of this unit are shown below.

## Bus 2


## Bus 3


## Bus 4

* The main effect parameters assigned to BUS 1 and BUS 2 are saved when you hold down the [MARK] button for at least three seconds while
holding down the [SHIFT] button.
The effect parameters on this unit are shared in common with some buses to which effects are assigned.
Using the effects
For instance, the sub-parameters of effects assigned to INPUT, BUS 1 and BUS 2 are shared in common. For this reason, when you assign the
same effect to INPUT and BUS 1 and then change the INPUT FX sub-parameters, the BUS 1 sub-parameters become the same values.
The effect parameters are likewise shared between BUS 3 and BUS 4 as well.
Turning Effects on/off at the desired timing
Applies effects only while you hold down the effect buttons (EFFECT GRAB).
This lets you quickly turn an effect on/off in time with what you play.
Play back a sample.
While holding down the [VALUE] knob, press an effect button (such as the [FILTER+DRIVE] button).
The effect turns on only while you’re pressing the effect button.
Temporarily output only the effect sound (MUTE BUS)
Temporarily turns off the audio sent to the bus (the sample playback sound or the sound inputted to the INPUT jack), and outputs only the sound
of the effect.
This lets you output just the sound of reverberation or delay feedback to create a break when you’re playing.
Play back a sample.
Hold down the [SHIFT] button and press the [BUS FX] button.
MUTE BUS turns on. This shuts off the audio signal sent to the bus.
To turn MUTE BUS off, hold down the [SHIFT] button and press the [BUS FX] button again.
MUTE BUS turns off. This allows the audio signal to be sent to the bus. At the same time, the effects assigned to the bus turn off.
How MUTE BUS works
The MUTE BUS feature works in a complex way to control the audio sent to the buses and the effects at the same time.
This shows the audio signal flow when using MUTE BUS.
