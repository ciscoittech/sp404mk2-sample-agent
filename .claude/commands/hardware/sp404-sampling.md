The sample is saved to the pad.
Adding a count-in before sampling
This feature adds a count-in before sampling begins. This gives you time to get ready to play before sampling actually begins.
Hold down the [SHIFT] button and press the pad [10].
The value changes in order each time you press pad [10] while holding down the [SHIFT] button.

## Count-In 2Meas

Adds a two-measure count-in before sampling.

## Count-In Wait

When the input audio signal exceeds the level set in the Auto Trig Level parameter, sampling begins.

## Count-In Off

No count-in is used. Sampling starts immediately after you press the pads [1]–[16] to sample and then press the [REC]
button.
Automatically setting the end point of a sample (END SNAP)
By setting the BPM (tempo) and then sampling, you can automatically set the beat that’s just before the sampling end beat as the “end point” (the
timing at which the sample stops).
Press the [REC] button.
Empty pads to which samples haven’t been assigned blink red.

Resampling a sample (RESAMPLE)
Resampling means sampling a sample itself while it’s playing back. You can sample the sound of a sample to which effects are applied, or sample
the sound of multiple samples that are playing back at the same time, creating a single sample.

## Memo

Also, by turning the pattern sequencer on beforehand (the [PATTERN SELECT] button lights up), you can resample a pattern in the same way as you
would resample a sample.
Press the [RESAMPLE] button.

## Memo

The metronome sounds when the “Metronome:REC” parameter is “ON” (the SYSTEM parameter “CLICK (p. 123)”).
Press pad [9] while holding down the [SHIFT] button to turn the metronome sound on/off.
Sets the sample length (number of measures).
Controller
Value
Explanation
[CTRL 2] knob
1-32, ∞
Sets the sample length (number of measures).
Press the [RECORD SETTING] button.
The input setting screen appears.
Use the [CTRL 2] knob to set ROUTING to “Mix”.
Sampling (SAMPLING)

## Memo

When ROUTING is set to “ExtIn,” only the audio input from an external device is sampled (the sample’s audio is not included in the resample). You
can sample your performance while playing back samples as backing sounds.
Use the [CTRL 1] knob to adjust the tempo during sampling (the sample tempo), and use the [CTRL 3] knob to adjust the
volume of audio input from an external device.
Press the [EXIT] button or the [RESAMPLE] button.
Press the pads [1]–[16] that are blinking red.
Empty pads to which samples haven’t been assigned blink red.
When you press an empty pad, the pad lights up orange, and a message “Press Pad to START” is shown.
Press pads [1]–[16] to select a sample.
Sampling begins when the pattern starts playing back.
If you decide to cancel sampling, press the [EXIT] button.

## Memo

You can also press the [REC] button to begin sampling. You can begin sampling when you want, while playing back samples as backing
sounds.
You can control the start/stop of recording from an external MIDI device using the start command (FA)/stop command (FC).
To quit sampling, press the pads [1]–[16] used for sampling or the [REC] button once more.
The sample is saved to the pad.
Sampling what you previously played (SKIP-BACK SAMPLING)
You can sample what you played up to 25 seconds ago (default) using the skip-back sampling function, which works even if you hadn’t started
sampling.
This lets you “go back in time” to sample a passage you played well during repeated practice, or to sample a phrase you played well when you
were just improvising.
Play back a sample or pattern, or switch the [EXT SOURCE] button on and play the instrument that’s connected to this unit.
When the unit detects an audio level at or above a certain level, the unit begins recording to skip-back memory (which is used only for
sampling past audio signals). At this time, the [MARK] button blinks.
Press the [MARK] button.
After “SKIP BACK...” appears, the waveform of the audio in skip-back memory is displayed.
Sampling (SAMPLING)
Press the [REC] button.
“Select Pad To Save” appears. Empty pads to which samples haven’t been assigned blink red.
Press pads [1]–[16] to select the pad to which you want to assign the skip-back memory audio.
Now the audio from skip-back memory is assigned to the pad.

## Note

Once you press the [EXIT] button without assigning the skip-back memory audio or turn off this unit, the skip-back memory is lost.
If you want to keep the skip-back memory audio, make sure to assign it to a pad.

## Memo

When you set the "Mark Function" system parameter to "SBS Long", the maximum time available for recording to skip-back memory can be set
to a maximum of 40 seconds.
Refer to the “MARK Function (p. 122)” SYSTEM parameter for details.
You can’t use skip-back sampling and the looper function at the same time.
Skip-back sampling: how it works, and what its restrictions are
Skip-back memory records up to 25 seconds (default) of audio. Anything recorded more than 25 seconds ago is erased, and can’t be previewed
or sampled.
The skip-back memory audio starts and pauses recording according to the setting of the Auto Trig Level parameter. When the input audio
signal exceeds the level set in the Auto Trig Level parameter, skip-back memory starts recording. When the input audio signal falls below the
level set in the Auto Trig Level parameter for at least three seconds, skip-back memory recording is paused.
Skip-back memory is not recording if the [MARK] button is not blinking, and thus can’t be previewed or sampled. If you press the [MARK]
button at this time, the message “No SKIP BACK Trigger Data” is shown.

Adding unique rhythmic character to a sample (Groove)
You can add a unique rhythmic character to a sample to make it groove.
For instance, this lets you shift the timing of a sample’s beat to create a distinctive groove, even if the looped drum sound that you’ve input was
played straight on the beat.
This timing shift is stored in a template (the Groove parameter).
Since the template plays back in sync with the sample’s tempo, you must correctly set the sample’s tempo beforehand.
Press the [PITCH/SPEED] button.
Press the [ROLL] button.
The groove parameter screen appears.
Use the [CTRL 1]–[CTRL 3] knobs to edit the parameter.

shifts the timing to a fixed value.
The sound quality may suffer if
you raise the rate too high.
[CTRL 3] knob
Groove
Off, 8<, 8<<, 8>, 8>>, 16<, 16<<,
16>, 16>>

There are templates for 8-beat and
16-beat grooves, and each
template has its own swing
strength and timing.

## Memo

You can get a suitable groove by using a loop sample that’s set to the correct tempo (BPM).
All templates are set to a 4/4 beat (time signature). You can’t change the beat.
Also, you might not get the desired groove effect if you use a sample that’s not in 4/4 time for the groove.
You might not be able to get a suitable groove with some samples.
