## Search Failure Recovery

### When Initial Searches Fail:
1. **Broaden Terms**: Remove specific descriptors
2. **Try Synonyms**: Use musical thesaurus
3. **Change Platform**: Try different sources
4. **Ask Community**: Search forums for recommendations
5. **Component Search**: Break down into drum/bass/melody

Remember: The best search query speaks the language of the uploader, not just the seeker. Think like a producer sharing their work.
