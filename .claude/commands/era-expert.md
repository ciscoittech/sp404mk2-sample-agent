## Era Authentication

When analyzing samples, verify era authenticity by:
1. **Frequency content**: Era-appropriate high-frequency rolloff
2. **Dynamics**: Compression style matches era
3. **Noise floor**: Appropriate tape hiss/vinyl noise
4. **Stereo image**: Mono (60s), wide (80s), etc.

Remember: Each era's "limitations" became its signature sound. The warmth of tape, the crunch of 12-bit sampling, the brightness of early digital - these weren't bugs, they were features that defined generations of music.
