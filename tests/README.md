# SP404MK2 Sample Agent - Test Suite

## Overview

This test suite provides comprehensive testing for the SP404MK2 Sample Agent project. Due to differences between the initial test design and the actual implementation, we've created a pragmatic testing approach that verifies core functionality.

## Running Tests

### Basic Functionality Tests (Recommended)

These tests verify that the system's core components work:

```bash
# Run basic tests
python -m pytest tests/test_basic_functionality.py -v

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest tests/test_basic_functionality.py --cov=src --cov-report=html
```

### All Tests

```bash
# Run all tests (some may fail due to implementation differences)
python run_tests.py

# Run specific test suites
python run_tests.py unit
python run_tests.py integration
```

## Test Status

### ✅ Working Tests

- `test_basic_functionality.py` - Verifies core imports, agent creation, and basic operations
- Basic agent instantiation
- Model validation
- Tool creation

### ⚠️ Tests Needing Updates

The original test suite was written based on expected implementation details that differ from the actual code. These tests need to be updated:

1. **Unit Tests**
   - `test_groove_analyst.py` - Method names and model fields differ
   - `test_era_expert.py` - Needs alignment with actual implementation
   - `test_sample_relationship.py` - Model structure differences
   - `test_audio.py` - Function names differ (audio.py vs audio_tools.py)

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Need to update imports and method calls

3. **E2E Tests**
   - Class names differ (SP404Chat vs SP404ChatAgent)

## Key Differences Found

1. **Module Names**
   - `audio_tools.py` → `audio.py`
   - `Logger` → `AgentLogger`

2. **Class Names**
   - `SP404Chat` → `SP404ChatAgent`
   - `GrooveAnalysis` → `GrooveAnalysisResult`

3. **Model Fields**
   - `GrooveCharacteristics` has different fields than expected
   - `TimingAnalysis` expects different field types

4. **Method Names**
   - Many private methods have different names or don't exist
   - Public APIs differ from test expectations

## Recommendations

1. **For Immediate Testing**: Use `test_basic_functionality.py` to verify the system works
2. **For CI/CD**: Configure to run only the basic tests initially
3. **For Full Coverage**: Gradually update the unit tests to match actual implementation

## Adding New Tests

When adding new tests:

1. First verify the actual implementation
2. Use the working tests as templates
3. Mock external dependencies (YouTube API, audio files, etc.)
4. Focus on public APIs rather than internal methods

## Test Coverage

Current coverage with basic tests: ~16%

To improve coverage:
1. Add more integration tests for actual workflows
2. Test error handling paths
3. Add performance benchmarks
4. Create fixtures that match actual data structures

## Next Steps

1. Update unit tests one by one to match implementation
2. Create integration tests for key workflows
3. Add E2E tests for user scenarios
4. Set up CI/CD to run working tests
5. Gradually increase coverage as tests are fixed
