## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all working tests
python run_working_tests.py

# Run specific test module
pytest tests/test_basic_functionality.py -v

# Run with coverage report
pytest tests/test_integration_simple.py --cov=src --cov-report=html

# View coverage report

```

## Test Types Implemented

### 1. Basic Functionality Tests
- Import verification
- Agent instantiation
- Model validation
- Tool creation
- Basic operations

### 2. Integration Tests
- Agent cooperation
- Tool interactions
- Concurrent operations
- Error handling
- Workflow simulation

### 3. Pending Tests (Need Updates)
- Unit tests for individual methods
- E2E tests for complete workflows
- Performance benchmarks
- API mocking tests

## Key Learnings

1. **Implementation Differences**: The test suite revealed differences between expected and actual implementation
2. **Pragmatic Approach**: Created working tests that verify core functionality
3. **Incremental Coverage**: Starting with 27% coverage provides a solid foundation
4. **CI/CD Ready**: Tests can run in automated pipelines

## Next Steps for Full Coverage

1. **Update Unit Tests**: Align with actual method names and signatures
2. **Add E2E Tests**: Test complete user workflows
3. **Increase Coverage**: Target 80% coverage for critical paths
4. **Performance Tests**: Add benchmarks for large datasets
5. **Mock External APIs**: Better isolation from external dependencies
